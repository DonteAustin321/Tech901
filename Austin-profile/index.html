        <div class="bio"><p>My superpower is making it through the networking portion of the IT Foundations course. I still have nightmares about it though.. I am commited to growing my skillset and would eventually like to get into cybersecurity. It feels to me like it would be a big challenge with something new every day, and I find that very exciting. Solving problems is something I enjoy doing and I always feel good after figuring out something that at first seemed impossible. While I may be bad at studying, I am very good at absorbing information and that is my actual superpower! </p></div>
